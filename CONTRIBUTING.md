# Contributing to sorowill-sdk

This repo participates in the **Stellar Wave Program** on [Drips](https://drips.network/wave). Contribution work is tied to issues that maintainers tag for an active Wave, and contributors earn rewards proportional to the Points assigned to the issues they resolve.

## Ground rules

- **Do not start work on any issue until you have been assigned by the maintainer.** Applying to an issue does not mean you're assigned — wait for confirmation (via the Drips Wave dashboard or a direct assignment on GitHub) before opening a PR.
- Keep PRs scoped to the issue they resolve. Unrelated changes slow down review and can cost you the Wave window.
- Be responsive during an active Wave — issues must be resolved before the Wave ends for Points to be awarded.

## Error messages and sensitive data

SoroWill is a financially sensitive application. When adding or modifying errors in `src/errors.ts` or `src/SoroWillClient.ts`, follow these rules:

- **Never embed user-supplied or contract-derived values directly in `Error.message`.** Values that must not appear in a message string include: wallet addresses, contract IDs, token addresses, raw XDR blobs, and simulation error strings from the RPC node. These can all end up in a third-party error-tracking pipeline (Sentry, Datadog, etc.) if a consumer logs `error.message` without redaction.
- **Expose sensitive context as named, typed properties instead.** The SDK's `SimulationError`, `TransactionSubmissionError`, and `InvalidCursorError` classes show the pattern: the sensitive value is stored on a typed property (`.simulationError`, `.errorXdr`, `.cursor`) so callers can decide programmatically whether to log it.
- **Method names and status code enums are acceptable in messages** because they contain no user data.
- **Debug-mode logging** (`DebugLogger`) is gated behind `debug: true` in `SoroWillClientOptions`. Even inside that gate, do not log owner addresses or other wallet keys — prefer will IDs, tx hashes, and timing information only.

## Branch naming

Use the issue number in your branch name:

```
feat/N-short-description
fix/N-short-description
```

## Pull requests

- Your PR description must reference the issue it resolves (e.g. `Closes #12`).
- Make sure `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` all pass cleanly before requesting review.
- Add or update unit tests in `test/` for any behavior change to `src/utils.ts` or type validation logic.
- Keep the public API in `src/index.ts` in sync with any new exports.
- **When adding a new top-level export**, also add a row to the _Full public API_ table in `README.md` (under the appropriate section). The table is the single source of truth for what the package exposes — keeping it current helps consumers discover the API without reading the source. A missing row will be flagged during code review.
- **If your PR changes public behavior** (new features, breaking changes, deprecations, or behavioral fixes), add a bullet entry under the `[Unreleased]` section of [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md). The release workflow (`publish.yml`) triggers from published GitHub Releases, and the changelog is the authoritative record of what shipped in each version.

## API reference

The full public API reference is generated from JSDoc comments via [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/).

### Generating locally

```bash
npm run docs:api
```

Output lands in `docs/api/` (gitignored). Open `docs/api/index.html` in a browser to browse the
generated HTML reference. Alternatively, run the command and point a local HTTP server at the
directory:

```bash
npx serve docs/api
```

### Keeping docs in sync

- Every public symbol exported from `src/index.ts` should have a JSDoc comment (`/** ... */`).
- When adding or renaming exports, re-run `npm run docs:api` locally and verify the symbol appears
  in the generated output before opening your PR.
- TypeDoc reads from `typedoc.json` at the repo root — adjust category or navigation settings
  there, not via CLI flags.

### Publishing to GitHub Pages

The reference can be published automatically via GitHub Actions. Add a workflow job such as:

```yaml
- name: Generate API docs
  run: npm run docs:api

- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: docs/api
```

Trigger this job on every push to `main` (or as a separate manual/release workflow). GitHub Pages
must be enabled in the repository settings with the source set to the `gh-pages` branch. Once
deployed, the reference is reachable at
`https://sorowill.github.io/sorowill-sdk/`.

## ScVal / XDR snapshot tests

Every state-changing method encodes its arguments into Soroban `ScVal`s via
`spec.funcArgsToScVals(method, args)` before building a transaction. A future
upgrade to `@stellar/stellar-sdk` could silently change that encoding — for
example altering how `u64` or `Address` values are serialised — producing
transactions that the contract rejects, with nothing in CI catching the
regression.

Snapshot tests lock in the exact `ScVal` / XDR output for each method's
typical arguments so any encoding change is caught immediately.

### Running the snapshot tests

```bash
npm test
```

Vitest runs all tests including the snapshot suite. Snapshot files live next to
the test files under `test/__snapshots__/`.

### Reviewing a snapshot diff

When a snapshot assertion fails you will see a diff like:

```
- Snapshot  "create_will args ScVal snapshot 1"
+ Received

  - scvMap: [ { key: scvSymbol("owner"), val: scvAddress(...) }, ... ]
  + scvMap: [ { key: scvSymbol("owner"), val: scvAddress(...) }, ... ]
```

Before updating, answer these questions:

1. **What changed?** Identify the `@stellar/stellar-sdk` commit or release note
   that explains the encoding difference.
2. **Is the new encoding correct on-chain?** Simulate the new XDR against the
   deployed testnet contract (`npm run test -- --reporter=verbose`) and confirm
   it succeeds.
3. **Is the change intentional?** If a dependency upgrade deliberately changes
   encoding for correctness, the snapshot should be updated. If you cannot
   explain why the encoding changed, treat it as a potential regression and do
   not update.

### Intentionally updating snapshots

Once you have verified the new encoding is correct, update the snapshot file:

```bash
npx vitest run --update-snapshots
```

Commit **both** the source change that caused the encoding to shift (e.g. the
`package.json` version bump) **and** the updated snapshot file in the same PR,
with a description explaining why the XDR shape changed. Reviewers should be
able to cross-reference the diff against the upstream SDK changelog.

### Adding a snapshot for a new method

When you add a new state-changing method, add a corresponding snapshot
assertion in `test/sorowill-client-sdk.test.ts` (or a dedicated snapshot test
file). Use `toMatchSnapshot()` on the serialised ScVal array:

```ts
it('encodes create_will args to the expected ScVal shape', () => {
  const scVals = spec.funcArgsToScVals('create_will', {
    owner: 'GABC...',
    token: 'CABC...',
    amount: 1_000_000n,
    beneficiaries: [{ address: 'GBEN', percentage: 100 }],
    checkin_period_days: 90n,
    grace_period_days: 7n,
    guardians: [],
  });
  expect(scVals.map((v) => v.toXDR('base64'))).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

Run `npx vitest run --update-snapshots` once to write the initial snapshot,
then commit it. All subsequent runs will assert against that baseline.

## Soroban sandbox integration tests

`test/soroban-sandbox-integration.test.ts` exercises the full will lifecycle
against a real deployed Soroban contract rather than a mock. It is skipped
automatically — not run in CI — unless all three of its required environment
variables are set:

```bash
export SOROBAN_SANDBOX_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8000  # optional, defaults to this
export SOROBAN_CONTRACT_ID=C...       # a deployed SoroWill contract instance
export SOROBAN_OWNER_ACCOUNT=G...     # funded account used as the will owner
export SOROBAN_BENEFICIARY_ACCOUNT=G...  # funded account used as a beneficiary

npx vitest run test/soroban-sandbox-integration.test.ts
```

To run it locally, deploy the SoroWill contract to a local `soroban-cli`
sandbox (or Futurenet/testnet) using two funded accounts for the owner and
beneficiary roles, then set the variables above to that deployment before
running the command. CI does not set these variables, so this suite is
expected to show as skipped there — see the "Warn if Soroban sandbox
integration tests are skipped" step in
[`.github/workflows/test.yml`](./.github/workflows/test.yml) for the
annotation that surfaces this in each run.

## Local setup

See the [README](./README.md#installation) for installation and how to run the test suite.

## Releasing

Publishing to npm is fully automated by [`.github/workflows/publish.yml`](./.github/workflows/publish.yml), which runs on every GitHub Release being **published** and, in order, typechecks, tests, builds, and runs `npm publish --access public`. There is no separate "release" branch or manual publish step — creating the GitHub Release *is* what ships the package.

1. **Decide and apply the version bump.** This project follows [semver](https://semver.org/): patch for fixes, minor for backwards-compatible additions, major for breaking changes to the public API in `src/index.ts`. On `main`, with a clean working tree, run one of:

   ```
   npm version patch   # or: minor / major
   ```

   This bumps `version` in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, commits the change, and creates a matching local git tag (e.g. `v0.2.0`). Push both:

   ```
   git push origin main --follow-tags
   ```

2. **Create the GitHub Release that triggers `publish.yml`.** Go to the repo's Releases page (or run `gh release create`) and create a release using the tag you just pushed. The tag name should match the version (e.g. `v0.2.0`); the release title and notes can summarize what changed since the last release. Publishing the release (not just saving it as a draft) fires the `release: published` event and starts the workflow.

3. **Watch the workflow run.** Check the Actions tab for the `Publish` run triggered by your release. If typecheck, test, or build fails, the job stops before `npm publish` runs — fix forward with a new commit/tag/release rather than trying to reuse the failed tag.

Because the publish step authenticates as `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}`, only maintainers with access to configure repository secrets can make this workflow succeed — the `NPM_TOKEN` secret is scoped to whoever administers this repo's GitHub settings, not to individual Wave contributors. If you're a contributor working an issue that requires a release to close out, ask a maintainer to cut it once your PR is merged.
